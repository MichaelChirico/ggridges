  No barcode duplicates were found.

SUMMARY:
4 lanes were identified and named:
  A, B, C, D
The average number of SNPs per cell for all lanes was: 518.1
Out of 60 cells in the Seurat object, Demuxlet assigned:
    56 cells or 93.3% as singlets
    4 cells or 6.7% as doublets
    and 0 cells as too ambiguous to call.
0 cells were not annotated in the demuxlet.best file.

> ### Previous Version Compatibility
> # Mistakenly, dittoBarPlot used to remove factor identities entirely from the
> #  data it used. This manifests as ignorance of a user's set orderings for
> #  their data. That is nolonger done by default, but to recreate old plots,
> #  restoring this behavior can be achieved with 'retain.factor.levels = FALSE'
> # Set factor level ordering for a metadata we'll give to 'group.by'
> myRNA$groups_reverse_levels <- factor(
+     myRNA$groups,

> # dittoBarPlot will now respect this level order by default. 
> dittoBarPlot(myRNA, "clustering", group.by = "groups_reverse_levels")
> # But that respect can be turned off...

Loading required namespace: ComplexHeatmap
'magick' package is suggested to install to give better rasterization.
